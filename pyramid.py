# Initialization:
# height starts at 0 (no layers built yet).
# layer_blocks starts at 1 (first layer needs 1 block).
# Loop Until Blocks Run Out:
# If we have enough blocks for the current layer, we use them.
# Increase height since the layer is completed.
# The next layer requires one more block than the previous.
# Exit When Blocks Are Insufficient:
# The loop stops when we donâ€™t have enough blocks for the next layer.
# Print the Pyramid Height:
# The final height is the maximum fully completed layers.
