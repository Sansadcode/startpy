## you need to remember how to write the code so
# everything is executed properly check second code
#1 code
# bananas=int(input("how many"))
# if bananas >= 1:
#     print("i have a large bunch of bananas")
# elif bananas >=5: # this will not get executed
#     print("i have a small bunch of bananas")
# else:
#     print("I dont have any bananas")

#2 code that can run all lines of code depending onthe value
bananas=int(input("how many"))
if bananas >= 5:
    print("i have a large bunch of bananas")
elif bananas >= 1: # this will not get executed
    print("i have a small bunch of bananas")
else:
    print("I dont have any bananas")
